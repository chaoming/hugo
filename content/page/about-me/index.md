Hi,

Welcome to my website. I am Chaoming Li. I am passionate about technologies and entrepreneurship.

I am the CEO and co-founder of [Insightech](https://www.insightech.com), a digital analytics solution startup that focuses on helping businesses to understand their digital experiences and to lift their conversion rates in the digital channel.

I develop software mainly using Go for the backend and React for the frontend. I like to learn about new ideas and technologies and apply them to solve problems in the real world. You can find a big portion of my posts about tech here.

If you like what I write about and what I am doing, feel free to follow me on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chaomingli/), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ChaomingLi) and [Github](https://github.com/chaoming).
